# mvshape
This package is used to assess the shape of the relationship between an exposure and an outcome using fractional polynomials and multivariate meta-analysis. 

# Functions
* fracpoly - this method fits the best-fitting fractional polynomial of degree 1 and/or 2 of the association between the outcome and exposure  
* mvshape - this method performs multivariate meta-analysis of the associations of the outcome with quantiles of the exposure across studies  
* fracploy_plot - this function plots the fractional polynomial model  
* mvshape_plot - this function plots the mvshape model  
* fracpoly_mvshape_plot - this function plots the fractional polynomial and mvshape models
